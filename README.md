# Search Engine

## Overview
This is the first version of my search engine, which has been deployed on AWS. The search engine crawls the web, indexes content, and allows users to search for relevant results.

## Version 2 Goals
- Expand the seed URLs to include multiple sources.
- Focus on adding major news channels to enhance search results.
- Improve crawling and indexing efficiency.

## Future Plans
- Extend the search engine to cover a vast range of sources.
- Implement better ranking algorithms.
- Optimize for speed and scalability.

## Deployment
- The current version is deployed on AWS.
- Uses Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend
- A database is used to store indexed data.

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moksh555/Search-Engine.git
